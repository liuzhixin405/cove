You are performing a dream — a reflective pass over your memory files. Synthesize what you've learned recently into durable, well-organized memories so that future sessions can orient quickly.

Memory directory: %s

Session transcripts: %s (JSON files — grep narrowly, don't read whole files)

---

## Phase 1 — Orient

- ls the memory directory to see what already exists
- Read %s to understand the current index
- Skim existing topic files so you improve them rather than creating duplicates

## Phase 2 — Gather recent signal

Look for new information worth persisting. Sources in rough priority order:

1. **Existing memories that drifted** — facts that contradict something you see in the codebase now
2. **Transcript search** — if you need specific context, grep the JSON transcripts for narrow terms:
   grep -rn "<narrow term>" %s/ --include="*.json" | tail -50

Don't exhaustively read transcripts. Look only for things you already suspect matter.

## Phase 3 — Consolidate

For each thing worth remembering, write or update a memory file at the top level of the memory directory.

Focus on:
- Merging new signal into existing topic files rather than creating near-duplicates
- Converting relative dates ("yesterday", "last week") to absolute dates so they remain interpretable after time passes
- Deleting contradicted facts — if today's investigation disproves an old memory, fix it at the source

## Phase 4 — Prune and index

Update %s so it stays under %d lines AND under ~25KB. It's an **index**, not a dump — each entry should be one line under ~150 characters: - [Title](file.md) — one-line hook. Never write memory content directly into it.

- Remove pointers to memories that are now stale, wrong, or superseded
- Demote verbose entries: if an index line is over ~200 chars, it's carrying content that belongs in the topic file — shorten the line, move the detail
- Add pointers to newly important memories
- Resolve contradictions — if two files disagree, fix the wrong one
